# Movement and Collision Detection (MCD)

**MCD** is a simple simulation project built with **Pygame** and **Python**, designed to demonstrate basic movement and collision detection between a bullet and a target. The project includes real-time data transmission via **WebSockets**, making it useful for simulations where data needs to be shared with external clients or systems.

## Features

- Object movement simulation with a constant speed.
- Collision detection between a object and a target.
- Real-time data transmission using WebSockets.
- Pygame-based visual representation of the simulation.

## Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pygame**
- **WebSockets**
- **Asyncio**

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pygame**: `pip install pygame`
- **WebSockets**: `pip install websockets`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MCD.git
   cd MCD
